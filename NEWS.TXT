################################# PIRANHA NEWS #################################

New in Piranha v1.2.0
  * This news file was added to keep track of updates to Piranha 
  * Piranha now outputs only the significant sites as per a threshold on the 
    p-value of a site. By default that threshold is 0.05, but it can be set 
    using the new option -p. To make piranha output all of the sites (i.e. 
    make Piranha behave in the same way as earlier versions), use -p 1.  
  * Only the smallest 99% of positions are now used for fitting; they are 
    considered to represent the background. This value was empirically 
    arrived at by analysis of a collection of YYY CLIP-Seq datasets. However, 
    it can be manually set using the new -a option. If you find that too few 
    locations are significant, you may try decreasing this value.
  * p-value from the simple-distributions are now automatically corrected
	  to account for multiple hypothesis testing using the method of 
		Bejamini and Hochberg
