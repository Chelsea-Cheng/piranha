################################# PIRANHA NEWS #################################

New in Piranha v1.2.0
  * This news file was added to keep track of updates to Piranha 
  * Piranha now outputs only the significant sites as per a threshold on the 
    p-value of a site. By default that threshold is 0.01, but it can be set 
    using the new option -p. To make piranha output all of the sites (i.e. 
    make Piranha behave in the same way as earlier versions), use -p 1.  
  * All p-values output by Piranha are now automatically corrected for 
    multiple hypothesis testing using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg.
    This can be turned off using the -c option, which will make Piranha 
    output uncorrected p-values. 
  * For the simple (non-regression) distributions, only the smallest 99% 
    of positions are now used for fitting; they are considered to represent 
    the background. This value was empirically arrived at by analysis of a 
    collection of YYY CLIP-Seq datasets. However, it can be manually set 
    using the new -a option. If you find that too few locations are 
    significant, you may try decreasing this value.
	* It is now possible to use piranha to bin covariates as well as the 
	  response file (although the default is still to assume both response and 
		covariate files are already binned). When binning covariates (i.e. 
		assuming they are raw reads), Piranha will automatically populate missing 
		bins in the covariate file.
